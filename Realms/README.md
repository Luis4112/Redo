# Javascript-project

This project is basically my first long term project, which I'll do my best to fully develop it onto a testable product.

It's a text adventure game. It will include classes, levels, quests and probably side quests to be done. 

An RPG story which will be loosely based on whatever remnants of gameplay I may remember from "Realms of Chaos"

It was probably my first MMORPG ( using the term loosely here) experience, and I intend to bring in my version to the table.
